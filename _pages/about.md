Biography
---
I am a recent Ph.D graduate from Nanjing University, <font color=red>seeking a postdoctoral position in the field of wireless sensing.</font> During my doctoral studies, I was supervised by professor [Guihai Chen](http://cs.nju.edu.cn/gchen/) and associate professor [Haipeng Dai](http://cs.nju.edu.cn/daihp/). I also collaborated extensively with professor [Wei Wang](http://cs.nju.edu.cn/ww/). 

From 2011 to 2014, I am a member of [XiaoMing-Lab](http://www.xiaoming-lab.com/).

My Hobby
---
* Self balancing robot. I'm trying to combine such robot with smartphones to build a mobile platform for smart sensing. 
[See my self balancing robot at youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_J-YQ3ySKJA&list=PLxVt4lPz_cAiK9lSIy2-FKN1Th8wJ7R3r "My self balancing robot")

* MicroPython based on hardware platform such as Pyboard, Microbit, ESP8266 and ESP32. A NeoPixel led ring drived by ESP8266 is shown below.
